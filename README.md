# Advent of Code 2024 - Mike Fuller

This repository contains code snippets that I have used to solve problems on [AdventOfCode.com](https://www.adventofcode.com). All code is my own.

I find that I can get cracking with many of the problems quickly using Python, so you will usually find code snippets in this language. Occasionally I might use other languages for code practice.
